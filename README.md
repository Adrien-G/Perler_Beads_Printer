# Perler_Beads_Printer

A software for using the perler printer Beta (actually unusable without the printer.. continue working on it..)

actually finishing some minus problem on the printer. 
hope sharing printer 3D models who can be printed with a 3D printer (maybe on thingiverse.. don't know the website for now) and instructions to build it before the end of 2018.
